### Demo
http://express-pjax-es6.herokuapp.com

### Install and launch the app
```
npm install
npm run dev
open browser with http://localhost:3000
```

### Description
It's sample of the application, that 100% render at the backend(server).  
It's use PJAX approach.

Somebody will tell that it's legacy, and he will be right!  
But, it's have super strong compatibility with the old browsers,
and at the same time have nice dynamic web parts.  
An example you can find at:  
-> User details page  
-> Update friend block functionality

*All the code written with ES6: backend, frontend and even build part*

P.S.: If you think this approach is 100% sucks, tell this to:  
github.com  
jira.com  
vk.com  
bitbucket.com  
etc..
